Big data tackles two problems at the same time:
    1. store
    2. process

    of large volumes of data

Problems:
    volume
    value
    visualization
    velocity of transactions
    variety (structured, non structured)

Speed and processing is a major thing even if volume is less/more

My previous technology could not process more than 100 GB at a time hence I moved to Big Data.

10K plus solutions under BIG DATA.

IN Big Data, there are data layers for processing different technologies:
    storage
    processing
    testing
    visualization
    automation
    etc..etc...
